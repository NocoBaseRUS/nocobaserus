# Containers

Pages, popups, and drawers are considered as containers of blocks in NocoBase. The container is like a canvas in which various blocks can be placed.

## Tabs are supported inside containers

Multiple tabs can be added within popups, drawers, and pages. Add different blocks to each tab to display different content and actions. For example, in a customer information popup, add 3 tabs to display customer's personal information, order history, customer reviews.
