# Plugins

NocoBase is designed as a plugin architecture, and most of the functionality is powered by plugins, except for a lightweight kernel.

Theoretically, even built-in features can be replaced with new plugins as well.

## Plugin Manager

NocoBase provides a visual plugin manager to enable and disable plugins, or to configure them.

The plugin manager is still in its early stages and in the future hopefully we will find a wide variety of plugins here to meet the needs.
